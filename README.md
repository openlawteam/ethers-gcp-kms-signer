# ethers-gcp-kms-signer

This is a wallet or signer that can be used together with [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) applications.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i ethers-gcp-kms-signer
```

1. Create your asymmetric key as follows: https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-asymmetric-keys with  `EC_SIGN_SECP256K1_SHA256` algorithm.

2. Add the new service account to GCP with the correct KMS roles: Crypto KMS `Signer`, `Verifier`, `Viewer`

3. Provide the GCP service account credentials using an environment variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` [here](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/accessing-the-api#non_google_production_environment)

4. Use the `GcpKmsSigner` constructor as shown below, and that will resolve the correct key to sign the transaction.

```js
import { GcpKmsSigner } from "ethers-gcp-kms-signer";

const kmsCredentials = {
  projectId: "gcp-project-id", // your project id in gcp
  locationId: "global", // the location where your key ring was created
  keyRingId: "kr-1", // the id of the key ring
  keyId: "key-name", // the name/id of your key in the key ring
  keyVersion: "1", // the version of the key
};

const provider = ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider("ropsten");
let signer = new GcpKmsSigner(kmsCredentials);
signer = signer.connect(provider);

const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
  to: "0xE94E130546485b928C9C9b9A5e69EB787172952e",
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01"),
});
console.log(tx);
```

## Commit message format

This boiler plate uses the **semantic-release** package to manage versioning. Once it has been set up, version numbers and Github release changelogs will be automatically managed. **semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

Use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit` in order to invoke Commitizen commit helper that helps with writing properly formatted commit messages.
